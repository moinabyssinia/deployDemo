    <p>
        In order to remove spurious trends from the centennial surge reconstructions we apply changepoint analysis. This provides a reliable surge reconstruction that can be used for long-term trend analysis.     We use Bayesian changepoint analysis to detect the period when a variableâ€™s time series parameters start making significant changes or deviations from the normal. The analysis is performed using the annual variability time series of four variables, three predictors (zonal wind speed, meridional wind speed, and mean sea-level pressure from the 20CR and ERA-20C reanalysis) and the reconstructed surges (G-20CR  and G-E20C). The annual variabilities of the four variables are computed by calculating the annual standard deviation for the period covered by the two reanalyses: 1836-2015 for 20CR and 1900-2010 for ERA-20C.
